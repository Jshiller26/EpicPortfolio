`Hi!

Thanks for checking out my site. Feel free to explore the different apps and play with the file system. Start with the "My Projects" folder if you want to check out some cool stuff I have worked on in the past.
This web app is still in early development so expect bugs!

This portfolio is built with Next.js and uses several web technologies:
- React and TypeScript for the core functionality
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- Framer Motion for animations
